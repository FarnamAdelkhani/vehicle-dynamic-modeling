    "- Sketch the free body diagram for each rigid body in the list of elements and properly name and model all the forces and moments acting on the body.\n",
    "- Finally, by using Newton's second law, we write the mathematical equations that define our dynamic model, summing all forces along each axis for translational dynamics. In all moments about each rotational axis for rotational dynamics.\n",
